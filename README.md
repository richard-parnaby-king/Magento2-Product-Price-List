# Magento 2 - Product Price List 

Magento 2 product price lists allows you to simply create different categorisations of prices, based on customer, allowing you to five specific customers, specific products at a specific price. 
Simply login the admin after insalling and Go to Catalog -> Price Lists, and Click add new. 

Fill in the very simple form, and the rest will be taken care off.  

Its composed highly of plugins no core overides, so you can safly continue to dev, without risk of overwritting, 

We have also made sure to store the original data in extension attribute at the point of product getById and get and getList on search results, so you can always access it to modify it further. 

You can now configure the module how you so desire, 

Under System / Configuration / Sutton Silver / Price Lists
 - Enable Or Disable the module
 - Restrict the categories / products same option from custoemrs not in the product price lists
 - replace the add to cart form template if the customer is not in the list, its not restricted and you do not wish them to buy untill they have a quote
 - the lowest price from all lists is now used to give the price. 
 - you can now completly restrict the entire list from even showing the products at all, and redirect from the product if directly accessed
 - category resitrcition is now a configurable option.
 
 
Best part of it This Magento 2  customer quote price lists module is that its FREE and fully compatible with magento 2.1 upwords. 
 
Code now fully commnented aswell so it should make more sense :D
